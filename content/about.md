title: "About Me"
---
I am a Software Engineer living in [Washington, D.C. Metro Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_metropolitan_area).

I work at [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/), building data-intensive applications, data pipelines, and high-performance web services.

I'm interested in network protocols and programming languages. For the past couple of years [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) has been my primary programming language both professionally and for personal projects, but I'm also interested in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for its unique properties combining safety, speed and an expressive type system, and [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) for making the wonderful [Erlang VM](https://www.erlang.org/) approachable, and offering a unique take on building robust highly concurrent systems.

Projects I maintain:

* [Routes](https://github.com/anuragsoni/routes/), typed bi-direction routes for OCaml web applications
* [Http_async](https://github.com/anuragsoni/http_async), high performance asynchronous HTTP/1.1 server for OCaml

Previous projects:

* [Pgx](https://github.com/arenadotio/pgx), pure-OCaml PostgreSQL client
